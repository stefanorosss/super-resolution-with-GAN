Notes of reading paper SRDGAN
1. Paper's main contributions
  an end-to-end framework , including the  High-to-Low(H2L) GAN and  Low-to-High(H2L) GAN
2. Main problem of super resolution 
  (1) the mismatch problem of traing LR images and the captured LR image
      ( H2L GAN is used to lear the distribution of real LR images and generate the realistic HR|LR pairs for the L2H GAN )
  (2) the blind distortion during super resolution
      (L2H GAN takes the output HR|LR pairs as input and follow the network architecture of ESRGAN for super resolution )
3. Details of the paper
  (1) network architecture
  (2) H2L network and traning procedure
  (3) L2H network and traning procedure
  (4) Losses and theirs effects
    

4. Experiments and comparasion
